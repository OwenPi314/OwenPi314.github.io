I’m curious about how we can use AI to connect more deeply with students’ unique experiences, helping them explore their interests and make progress toward their goals. It’s a big, messy question, but one I find really exciting to think about.

Right now, I’m exploring three related questions:

__What can current AI actually do well, and where does it fall short?__
I’m particularly interested in whether large language models (LLMs) can reflect the diversity in how students explain scientific ideas and how well they can hold onto and recall details about a student’s experiences to offer personalized support.

__How can we design AI to make the most of its strengths?__
I’ve been thinking a lot about anthropomorphism—whether we should design AI to feel like tools or more like human-like agents—and what difference that makes in how people use them.

__How do these ideas hold up in real classrooms?__
I’m trying to understand how students perceive AI’s personality and intentions and how that shapes their interactions with it. Does it feel supportive? Frustrating? Something else entirely?
